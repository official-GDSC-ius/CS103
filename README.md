# IUS CS103

## A repository for publishing solutions for CS103 Fall 2023.



### [The official website of CS103's curriculum.](https://ecampus.ius.edu.ba/syllabus/cs103-introduction-programming)

#### That repository is quite old( 5 years old ðŸ˜… ), but I believe it could be useful for those who want to see some examples: [C++ How to Program, Ninth Edition Exercise Solutions](https://github.com/GorkemOkur/Cpp-How-to-Program-9-e).
